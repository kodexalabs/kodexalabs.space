JsonPromptEngineer.jsx

I need to create a document placeholder replacement agent that can find placeholders in text, ask users for replacement values, allow skipping, and show previews. I'll transform the existing JsonPromptEngineer component into a PlaceholderAgent that processes documents with placeholder patterns like {{placeholder}} or [placeholder].

Now I'll replace the main logic to handle document processing, placeholder detection, and user interaction for replacements.

Now I need to remove the old functions and update the UI components to match the new placeholder agent functionality.

Now I need to update the UI components to display the document input area, conversation, and preview sections for the placeholder agent.

Finally, I need to update the export statement to match the new component name.

Let me check the current server status to see if I can open a preview of the updated component.

The Next.js server is running successfully. Now I'll open the preview to show the updated PlaceholderAgent component.

I've successfully transformed the JsonPromptEngineer component into a Document Placeholder Agent that:

Key Features:

- Placeholder Detection : Automatically finds placeholders in documents using patterns like {{name}} or [company]
- Interactive Replacement : Guides users through replacing each placeholder one by one
- Skip Option : Allows users to skip any placeholder they don't want to replace
- Live Preview : Shows the processed document with all replacements applied
- Copy Function : One-click copy to clipboard for the final result
- Clean UI : Modern interface with document input area, conversation flow, and preview section
How it Works:

1. 1.
   Paste your document with placeholders into the text area
2. 2.
   Click "Process Document" or type "process"
3. 3.
   The agent finds all placeholders and asks for replacement values one by one
4. 4.
   Type replacement values or "skip" to leave placeholders unchanged
5. 5.
   Review the final document in the preview area
6. 6.
   Copy the result to clipboard when satisfied
File Updated:

- e:\sparks1111\.trae\JsonPromptEngineer.jsx - Completely rewritten as PlaceholderAgent
The component maintains all original formatting and only replaces the specified placeholders, making it perfect for document templates, form letters, or any text that needs dynamic content replacement. The Next.js server is running at http://localhost:3000 where you can test the new functionality.
