### Advanced Prompt Techniques

#### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
**Purpose:** Improve reasoning by asking the AI to show its work

**Example:**
```
Solve this step by step, showing your reasoning at each stage:

Problem: A company's revenue increased by 25% in Q1, decreased by 10% in Q2, and increased by 15% in Q3. If the Q3 revenue was $1,380,000, what was the original revenue at the start of Q1?

Please:
1. Identify what we know
2. Work backwards from Q3
3. Show calculations for each quarter
4. Verify your answer
```

#### Few-Shot Learning
**Purpose:** Provide examples to guide the AI's output format

**Example:**
```
Classify the sentiment of customer reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Examples:
Review: "This product exceeded my expectations! Great quality."
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "The item arrived damaged and customer service was unhelpful."
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "It's an okay product, nothing special but does the job."
Sentiment: Neutral

Now classify this review:
Review: "Fast shipping and the product works as described."
Sentiment:
```

#### Role-Based Prompting
**Purpose:** Give the AI a specific persona or expertise

**Example:**
```
You are a certified financial advisor with 15 years of experience. 
A client asks: "I'm 35 years old with $50,000 in savings. Should I invest in stocks or pay off my student loans first?"

Provide advice considering:
- Risk tolerance assessment
- Interest rates on loans
- Time horizon for investments
- Emergency fund requirements
- Tax implications

Structure your response as a professional consultation.
```

   "Write a professional email. Here's an example of the tone I want:
   
   Example: 'Thank you for your inquiry about our services. I'd be happy to schedule a call to discuss your specific needs...'
   
   Now write an email for: [your scenario]"
   ```

3. **Break Down Complex Tasks**
   - Split multi-step requests into separate prompts
   - Use workflows for complex processes
   - Provide intermediate checkpoints

#### Slow Performance
**Problem:** Prompts take too long to execute

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce Token Count**
   - Shorten input prompts
   - Lower max_tokens setting
   - Use more efficient models

2. **Optimize Parameters**
   - Lower temperature for faster responses
   - Reduce top_p value
   - Use streaming responses

#### Inconsistent Results
**Problem:** Same prompt gives different results

**Solutions:**
1. **Lower Temperature**
   - Use temperature 0.1-0.3 for consistent outputs
   - Add "Be consistent" instruction
   - Use seed values if available

2. **Add Constraints**
   ```
   "Always format your response exactly like this:
   1. [First point]
   2. [Second point]
   3. [Third point]
   
   Do not deviate from this format."
   ```
