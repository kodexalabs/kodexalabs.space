## Creative Brand Narrative Layout

This image presents an innovative brand identity system for "Sparks" arranged in a visually compelling, story-driven layout on a clean white background, designed to showcase the brand's creative energy and intelligent design philosophy.

### Central Brand Hero
**Dominant Flame Visualization (Center):** A large, artistic interpretation of the Sparks flame icon serves as the focal point.

The flame appears to be emerging from or dissolving into smaller geometric elements, symbolizing the transformation of ideas into reality.

**Brand Wordmark Integration:** "SPARKS" appears in Space Grotesk Bold (#0D0D0D) positioned strategically to complement the flame artwork, with individual letters showing subtle flame-inspired modifications.
