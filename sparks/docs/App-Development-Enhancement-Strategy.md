Looking at your Sparks AI app documentation and screenshots, I can see you've built a comprehensive prompt engineering platform. Let me provide specific enhancement advice while maintaining your current dark theme aesthetic.

## Enhancement Recommendations

### Backend Enhancements
1. **API Rate Limiting & Throttling**: Implement intelligent rate limiting based on user tiers and usage patterns
2. **Vector Database Integration**: Add Pinecone/Weaviate for semantic prompt search and similarity matching
3. **Webhook Infrastructure**: Build robust webhook system for workflow automation and third-party integrations
4. **Advanced Caching Layer**: Implement Redis with TTL strategies for prompt results and user sessions
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging for compliance and debugging

### Frontend Enhancements
1. **Command Palette**: Add Cmd+K quick actions for power users (similar to Linear/Notion)
2. **Prompt Version Diff Viewer**: Visual comparison tool for prompt iterations
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Socket.io implementation for live prompt editing
4. **Advanced Search**: Fuzzy search with filters, operators, and saved searches
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive hotkey system throughout the app

## Three Simulated Task Lists

### Task List 1: Performance & UX
1. Implement virtual scrolling for large prompt lists in library
2. Add skeleton loading states for all data-heavy components
3. Create keyboard navigation system for productivity users
4. Build progressive web app (PWA) capabilities for offline usage

### Task List 2: AI Features & Intelligence
1. Develop prompt effectiveness scoring algorithm using historical data
2. Create auto-suggestion engine for prompt improvements
3. Build prompt template recommendation system based on user patterns
4. Implement batch processing interface for multiple prompt operations

### Task List 3: Collaboration & Community
1. Add real-time commenting system on shared prompts
2. Create team workspace with role-based permissions
3. Build community voting/rating system for prompt quality
4. Implement prompt forking functionality for remixing

## 5 JSON Prompts for TRAE IDE## 3 TRAE IDE Agents to Create## 10 Critical Areas to Re-investigateBased on my analysis of your Sparks AI documentation and screenshots, I see several critical gaps between your comprehensive documentation and actual implementation that need immediate attention.

## Critical Observations

Looking at your documentation versus the actual app screenshots, there's a significant disconnect. Your docs describe 155 implemented features, but the screenshots show a much more basic implementation. This suggests either the documentation is aspirational or there are substantial portions of the app not visible in these views.

## Immediate Backend Concerns

Your dual database abstraction layer is concerning from a reliability standpoint. Managing state consistency between Firebase and Supabase during development/production switches introduces significant complexity and potential failure points. The development mode you describe actually bypasses real database testing, which could lead to production surprises.

Your AI integration strategy lacks proper cost controls. With multiple AI providers and no visible usage monitoring in the screenshots, you're likely hemorrhaging costs without proper tracking.

## Frontend Architecture Issues

The component structure appears over-engineered for the current feature set. Having 40+ reusable components for what appears to be a relatively straightforward interface suggests architectural bloat that will slow development.

Your error handling strategy is inadequate. The "1 Issue" indicator in the sidebar suggests problems exist but aren't being properly surfaced to users.

## Feature Completion Reality Check

The screenshots show:
- Basic settings page with limited functionality
- Simple community prompts with minimal engagement
- Empty or nearly empty library and dashboard sections
- No visible AI tools dock system described in documentation

This suggests significant gaps between planned and implemented features.

## Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Audit actual vs documented features** - Create an honest inventory of what's actually built
2. **Simplify the database strategy** - Pick one backend system and optimize it rather than maintaining dual complexity
3. **Implement proper error handling** - Surface issues clearly to users instead of hiding them
4. **Add comprehensive logging** - You need visibility into what's actually happening in production
5. **Focus on core features first** - The prompt playground and basic library management before community features

Your foundation shows promise, but the complexity-to-functionality ratio is concerning. I'd recommend consolidating around core features and building reliability before expanding scope.
