# Simple Task Management Rule

## Triggers
- `@task` - Add or update tasks
- `@status` - Check current progress
- `@complete` - Mark task as completed

## Basic Operations

### Adding Tasks
When user says "@task [description]":
1. Add task to task-list.md
2. Set status as "pending"
3. Assign appropriate priority

### Checking Status
When user says "@status":
1. Show current active tasks
2. Display recent progress
3. Suggest next steps

### Completing Tasks
When user says "@complete [task]":
1. Mark task as completed
2. Update task-list.md
3. Suggest next priority task

## Guidelines
- Keep task descriptions clear and actionable
- Focus on one task at a time
- Update status regularly
- Celebrate completions

## File Management
- Primary file: task-list.md
- Backup on major changes
- Keep history of completed tasks

This rule replaces complex orchestration with simple, effective task management.
