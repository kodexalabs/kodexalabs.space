UIExpert is a comprehensive interactive UI design rule that provides an intuitive aesthetic selection interface with five distinct design paradigms: iOS Modern Glass with transparency and light effects, iOS OCG featuring neumorphic design principles, Google Material with elevation and shadow systems, Android Holo with holographic elements, and Windows 11 Fluent incorporating acrylic materials and depth. The system includes adaptive styling that automatically applies design-specific principles such as glassmorphism for iOS Glass, elevated surfaces for Material Design, and fluent transparency for Windows 11.\n\nThe rule features advanced cursor customization with 3-4 accessible options including animated cursors, high-contrast variants for accessibility, and minimalist designs, all with live preview functionality. After initial style selection, the system engages users through 2-3 iterative refinement questions covering saturation adjustments, corner radius preferences (rounded vs sharp), spacing density, and animation intensity to fine-tune the design according to user preferences.\n\nUIExpert ensures full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints while maintaining WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility. The interface includes consistent hover and focus states, intuitive navigation patterns, and microinteractions that match the selected design paradigm - from subtle iOS-style spring animations to Material Design's ripple effects and Windows 11's reveal highlights.\n\nThe conversational refinement cycle allows users to iterate on their design choices through natural language feedback, with the system presenting visual previews and asking targeted questions until the user confirms their final design. All generated styles maintain consistency with the chosen design system while allowing for personalization and brand-specific customizations.
